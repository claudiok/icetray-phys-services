 @page physics-module The Use of I3PhysicsModule

 @section description-of-physics-module Description

 IceTray modules must inherit from the I3Module class of the @c icetray project.
 In some places the syntax  to be able to access data
 or services is cumbersome and not intuitive.  I3PhysicsModule inherits from
 I3Module and defines a number of helper methods to simplify the syntax.  
 Modules may inherit from I3PhysicsModule instead of I3Module directly to
 gain access to these helper methods.

 @section accessing-services-physics-module Accessing Standard Services with I3PhysicsModule
 
 The syntax that IceTray requires to access an external service is not 
 intuitive.  For example to access a service I3RandomService, the correct
 code is
 @code
 {
 I3RandomService& random = I3ContextAccess<I3RandomService>::Get(GetContext(),I3RandomService::DefaultName());
 }
 @endcode

 I3PhysicsModule defines a method I3PhysicsModule::GetRandom() which does
 just this, so that the syntax is simplified to
 @code
 {
 I3RandomService& random = GetRandom();
 }
 @endcode

 I3PhysicsModule does this for all the 'standard' services that are incldued
 in the @c phys-services project so that these are all legal calls:
 @code
 {
 I3RandomService& random = GetRandom(); 
 I3Calculator& calc = GetCalculator();
 I3ParticleDataService& particledata = GetParticleData();
 }
 @endcode

 It is expected that as the number of standard services available in 
 @phys-services increases that helper methods to access all of them will
 be put into I3PhysicsModule to simplify access to them.

 @section frame-access-physics-module Accessing Objects in the Frame

 IceTray has the concept of an I3Frame which contains the event (and related)
 data.  IceTray modules operate on an I3Frame, get the data out, manipulate it
 and return the data to the frame.

 The syntax for this is cumbersome, and so I3PhysicsModule defines some helper
 methods to get standard objects out of the frame.

 To get an I3Event and the I3EventHeader out of the frame, this is the syntax
 @code
 void Physics(I3Frame& frame){
   I3Event& event = I3FrameAccess<I3Event>::Get(frame,"Physics");
   I3EventHeader& header = I3FrameAccess<I3Event>::Get(frame,"PhysicsHeader");
 }
 @endcode
 
 The problem with this - besides being ugly and cumbersome - is that the user 
 is required to know what the character string name of the event is.  It would
 be much nicer - since there is normally only one event at a time - for the 
 user to just be able to type 'GetEvent' and get the event they want to look
 at.
 
 This is exactly what I3PhysicsModule does.  There is a method 
 'I3PhysicsModule::GetEvent(I3Frame&)' which returns the standard event 
 in the frame.

 So the syntax is changed - for modules that inherit from I3PhysicsModule - to:
 @code
 void Physics(I3Frame& frame){
    I3Event& event = GetEvent(frame);
    I3EventHeader header = GetEventHeader(frame);
 }
 @endcode

 The same approach is used by other objects that will appear in the frame, so
 all these are legal calls:
 @code
 void Physics(I3Frame& frame){
    I3Event& event = GetEvent(frame);
    I3EventHeader& event-header = GetEventHeader(frame);

    I3MCEvent& mcevent = GetMCEvent(frame);
    I3MCEventHeader& mcevent-header = GetMCEventHeader(frame);
 
    I3Geometry& geometry = GetGeometry(frame);
    I3GeometryHeader& geometry-header = GetGeometryHeader(frame); 
 }
 @endcode
